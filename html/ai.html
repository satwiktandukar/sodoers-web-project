Additionally, through this Artificial Intelligence, the company can also get the skilled the persons for the development of the company. Moreover the companies today think that they want to mechanize all the regular and routine work. And they think they can automate those regular works through the simple program Because, with the development of data science,  automation becomes more common. The application of this AI is majorly seen at website chat portal. You people when you come to the websites probably seen the welcome message. Then after actual conversation usually starts.</p><br><br>

			<b>Scope in context of Nepal</b>
			<p>For developing countries, AI has a more significant effect. We can see how technology-driven changes have helped such countries in tackling a number of challenges.<br>

			Nepal can benefit from this too, especially in Farming, Health Care, Resource provision, transportation, Electricity and so on. How can this be achieved depends on the policy adopted by the Government and the private sectors investing in the field of AI? There are some private companies already operating here in the field of AI, however, no such machines are used significantly until today.
