            <b>Introduction</b><br>
            <p><!-- change this-->Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user.The term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet.Large clouds, predominant today, often have functions distributed over multiple locations from central servers. If the connection to the user is relatively close, it may be designated an edge server.<br>

            Clouds may be limited to a single organization (enterprise clouds), or be available to multiple organizations (public cloud).<br>

            Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale.</p><br><br>

            <b>Why we need SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION?</b><!-- change this-->
            <p>Cloud storage is one of the greatest benefits cloud computing has to offer. Any relevant business data can be stored in the cloud, which makes it more accessible and usable. That said, your data can be accessed from any device and anywhere in the world, which is ideal for remote workers and offices</p>
            <p>By using cloud computing, you'll have more time to spend regarding the aspects of your business. It also offers more flexibility overall and the need of more bandwidth is also taken care of. Secure. Security is what every organization wants, and that's what Cloud Computing provides you.</p><br><br>
