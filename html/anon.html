			<h1 class="heading">Elon Musk gets a warning <br>from the hacker group "Anonymous"</h1>	
			<hr><br><br><br><p>
				Elon Musk appears to have been issued a warning by hacker group Anonymous. A video posted to the group's Facebook Page criticizes the Tesla CEO for his recent actions and tweets to do with cryptocurrency, accusing him of ruining people's lives. There is some question, however, about the legitimacy of the video, how worthwhile its cryptocurrency focus is, and the validity of its claims.</p>
				<p>

				The video begins by telling Musk that he has enjoyed "one of the most favorable reputations of anyone in the billionaire class" for a number of years due to his involvement in the development of electric cars and space exploration. However, it then suggests that people are beginning to see him as "nothing more than another narcissistic rich dude who is desperate for attention," also suggesting he has superiority and savior complexes rather than actual concern for humanity. It points to some of Tesla's practices as evidence of this and, curiously, also takes issue with Musk proclaiming himself "emperor of Mars."	</p><br>

				Perhaps more notable than all that, though, is that Forbes has published an article questioning the derivation of the video. While the piece references a YouTube version of it that seems to have been published later than the Facebook video on a verified but rarely used Anonymous account, it notes that the organization is so decentralized that it is difficult to ascertain who might actually be behind the video. Anyone could effectively release a video claiming to be part of the group, which isn't to say it isn't from the group, merely that it's unlikely Musk will be too concerned.
