			<b>Introduction</b><br>
			<p><!-- change this-->
			Web Development is some-what a vague term used to describe the building or maintaining of web sites hosted on the internet. I use the word ‘vague' because there's so many programming languages, frameworks and tools that are used for Web Development. Web Development could refer to a single web page built with HTML and CSS that might contain a couple hundred lines of code.web development is about creating applications which run in a web browser.</p><br><br>

			<b>Why we need Web development?</b><!-- change this-->
			<p>Website development is a way to make people aware of the services and/or products you are offering, understand why your products are relevant and even necessary for them to buy or use, and see which of your company's qualities set it apart from competitors. Displaying this information with high-quality images and thought-out presentation will have a large influence on customers, and it is important to strive towards making your product as relatable and appealing as possible.</p><br><br>
			<p>1. Communicate with your visitors effectively. Interacting with your audience is vital when it comes to generating more business. It is viable to make a website that enables you to get in touch with your customers and prospects, and you can produce valuable content for the audience associated with the industry or business you're in. Afterwards, post the content on your blog, share it on social media networks and respond to customers' comments and feedback promptly. This will show your clients the extent to which you’re concerned about their satisfaction and responsive to their needs.</p>
			<br><br>

			<p>2. Improve your connectivity. A website will facilitate things like expanding your reach and attracting more visitors to your business. Planning to make a responsive website design for your site will help make it accessible to an extensive range of users spanning several devices, such as tablets or smartphones. This will increase both your site's exposure and organic traffic.</p>

			<br><br>

			<p>3. Prove your reliability. A website offers a straightforward method of showing the credibility of a business, and the way a person represents his business online is vital for attracting more customers or visitors. Therefore, your website design should be handled in the best possible way, because a professional presentation speaks volumes as testimony to your business. With the help of website development, you can add your skills, credentials, experience, expertise and more in a single place. These details help you earn the trust and confidence of your visitors and serve as a reference point for customers interested in your business, making it easy for you to produce leads.</p>

			<b>Web Design vs. Web Development</b>
			<p>
				Although they share some skills, web designers and web developers must master specific competencies in their respective fields. Web design emphasizes aesthetics, so designers must have greater knowledge of what makes a website visually appealing and logical to users. They need to master design applications such as Adobe Dreamweaver, JavaScript, and scripting frameworks for multi-feature front-end applications. Furthermore, they must make sure the products they create fit a business’s brand, from logos to color schemes.

				Web developers, on the other hand, build the functional aspects of the website within the aesthetic parameters set forth by web designers. With their advanced programming skills, they ensure the product envisioned by the web designer comes to fruition. Web developers must master more extensive programming skills and software languages, such as Structured Query Language (SQL), Python, Java server development, machine learning, the development of APIs for interacting with objects, database tools and server architecture, and agile systems analysis.
